# Dynamic-HMM-Analysis-on-Simultaneous-iEEG-MEG

We applied Hidden Markov Model to a rare simultaneous MEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG) dataset in epilepsy patients for the first time. We hope the analysis pipeline comprise the first step towards establishing the correspondence between invasive and non-invasive recordings of non-pathological brain network dynamics in humans. The whole pipeline could be performed using the Oxford centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA) Software Library (OSL) (https://ohba-analysis.github.io/osl-docs/). This builds upon Fieldtrip (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) and SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) toolboxes.
