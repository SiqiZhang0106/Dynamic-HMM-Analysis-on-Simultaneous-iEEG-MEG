# Dynamic-HMM-Analysis-on-Simultaneous-iEEG-MEG

We applied Hidden Markov Model for the first time to a rare simultaneous MEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG) dataset in epilepsy patients after spikes removal. We hope the analysis pipeline comprise the first step towards establishing the correspondence between invasive and non-invasive recordings of non-pathological brain network dynamics in humans. The whole pipeline could be performed using the Oxford centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA) Software Library (OSL) (https://ohba-analysis.github.io/osl-docs/). This builds upon Fieldtrip (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) and SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) toolboxes.
